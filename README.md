# ajs-2.2-currency-converter
Advanced JavaScript | Workshop 2 Task 2

*Task*
In the workshop2 folder, you will find a sub-folder called converter. Open converter.html and converter.js in your editor.

This application works, but there is a problem...
– the rates are hard-coded in the function code, making them hard to manage.
– if we want to use the rates elsewhere in our app, we will have to duplicate them.

Your Task: Resolve this issue by defining an object to store the rates (with a property for each
rate)
– Use the currency code as the property name and the exchange rate as the value
– Create this object in the global scope
